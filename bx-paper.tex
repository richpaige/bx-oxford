\begin{abstract}
Bidirectional transformations, like software, or model and program transformations in general, need to be carefully engineered in order to provide guarantees about their correctness, completeness, acceptability and usability. This paper summarises a collection of lectures pertaining to engineering bidirectional transformations using Model-Driven Engineering techniques and technologies. It focuses on stages of a typical engineering lifecycle, starting with requirements and progressing to implementation and verification. It summarises Model-Driven Engineering approaches to capturing requirements, architectures and designs for bidirectional transformations, and suggests an approach for verification as well.
